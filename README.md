# Asteroid Radar App

### Description

This app allows data on asteroids that are expected to approach Earth in the near future to be downloaded from a NASA server. It provides basic information such as speed, distance from Earth, etc.
In order for the application to work properly, you must provide your own API key obtained from [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/) in the app/src/main/java/com/example/asteroidradar/Secret.kt file.
